# Tweet-Sentiment-Analyzer
This python script delves into the depths of Twitter to bring you real-time insights into public opinion.

Installation
> pip install Tweets-Analyzer

The search returns a list of tweets, which the script iterates over. For each tweet, the script uses the textblob module to calculate the sentiment of the tweet and prints it to the console.

For the code to work properly it's crucial to log in to your Twitter developer account and go to the Apps management screen. From there, click on the Details for your app and then click on the Keys and tokens tab. You should be able to see your API key and secret key there as well as tokens.
